\section{Introduction}

Hello World!

\section{Formatting}
\subsection{This is a subsection}

To make a new line in {\LaTeX} you have to make two retruns.
Otherwise LaTeX will consider the content to be in the same paragraph and therefore put it on the same line.
Even though this is a new line in the source document, LaTeX considers it part of the same paragraph.

Whereas, this is an entirely new paragraph!

\subsection{Bold, Italic, Emphatic, Underlined}
This is normal text.

\textbf{This is bold text.}

\textit{This is italic text.}

\emph{This is Emphatic text!}

\underline{This text is underlined.}

\subsection{Quotation Marks}

"This sentance is in normal quotation marks" 
"Notice how the opening quote mark looks backwards?"
{\LaTeX} is designed to be disambigious.
in LaTeX to orientation of quotation marks is taken litterally.

``To create a sentance with proper quotation marks you have to use backtics for the opening quote."
`For single quotes use a single backtic and an apostrophe.'
